renderlib-python
================

Python wrappers for `renderlib` C library.


# Installation

The package requires that `renderlib` and `matlib` libraries and headers are
installed somewhere in the system so that during installation it could compile
and link against them.

If dependencies are installed in a standard path which is looked up by C
compiler (`/usr/include` and `/usr/lib` respectively on UNIX systems, for
example), it should suffice to do:

    pip install renderlib

Otherwise, compiler options must be passed as environment variables so that the
wrapper builds and links properly, GCC/CLang example:

    # Fish
    env CFLAGS="-I/opt/renderlib/include/renderlib -I/opt/matlib/include" LDFLAGS="-L/opt/renderlib/lib -L/opt/matlib/lib" pip install renderlib

    # Bash
    CFLAGS="-I/opt/renderlib/include/renderlib -I/opt/matlib/include" LDFLAGS="-L/opt/renderlib/lib -L/opt/matlib/lib" pip install renderlib
